- Brazilian üáßüá∑
- Bachelor Degree in Computer Science
- Founding Engineer at [golioth.io](https://golioth.io)
- [Google Developer Expert for IoT](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-alvaro_viebrantz)

I'm a passionate Software Developer, touching all parts in the stack wherever is needed. Had experience with multiples stacks in my career, but lately I have been coding a lot in Go and currenly building an IoT Platform for Developers at [golioth.io](golioth.io) ‚ù§Ô∏è.

I really enjoy being part of a dev community and have been organizing local meetups since 2015 on two young developers communities here in my city - [Google Developers Group Cuiab√°](https://meetup.com/gdgcuiaba) and [DevMT](https://meetup.com/devmatogrosso), both which I saw starting from stratch and now having around a thousand members.

You can see me speaking at events as I love sharing knowledge with others, either by giving talks, writing an article or through some video content. I usually talk about Web, Mobile Development and mostly about the Internet of Things and Cloud.

In my spare time, I enjoy cooking something very yummy for my wife and my **five** lovely cats. Also, after 30 years, I finally found a sport that I enjoy playing, that is Tennis.

Here in my website you're going to find most of my work related to software development, public talks, articles and some of my open source contributions. Feel free to share and also give me feedback on the content.
