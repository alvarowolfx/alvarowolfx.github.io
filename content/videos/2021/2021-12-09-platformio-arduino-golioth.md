title: "Trying out Golioth with PlatformIO and Arduino Core"
summary: "In this video and associated post, we're talking about interfacing hardware to Golioth using popular tools like PlatformIO and Arduino Core (API). Alvaro shows how to use an ESP32 board from Adafruit with the Arduino Core on PlatformIO to talk to the Golioth MQTT endpoint. Golioth has a range of tools and resources for hardware and firmware engineers to get their devices talking to the cloud."
