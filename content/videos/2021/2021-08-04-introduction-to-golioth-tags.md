title: "Introduction to Golioth Tags"
summary: "Device tags are a key part of Golioth. Managing device deployments—large or small—gets easier when you start grouping devices together. Adding “tags” on the Golioth platform allows you to notate an individual device belongs to a broader group. If you’re developing something like smart light bulb and you have devices tagged “kitchen”, you can send an update over LightDB to the “kitchen” tagged devices and turn all the bulbs on or off. You can also group devices by hardware type, by end customer, by firmware deployment test group anything you can think of!"

Device tags are a key part of Golioth. Managing device deployments—large or small—gets easier when you start grouping devices together. Adding “tags” on the Golioth platform allows you to notate an individual device belongs to a broader group. If you’re developing something like smart light bulb and you have devices tagged “kitchen”, you can send an update over LightDB to the “kitchen” tagged devices and turn all the bulbs on or off. You can also group devices by hardware type, by end customer, by firmware deployment test group…anything you can think of!

Watch as Alvaro and Chris discuss device tags in this early access video.
