title: "Building REST APIs using gRPC and Go"
subtitle: " "
summary:
|
  Developing APIs over a RESTful interface with JSON payloads is kind of the de-facto standard nowadays, but it still lacks an easy way to build it with a well-defined interface and document it to be used by others. What if we can leverage gRPC's fast, type-safe, and modern way of building APIs and still be able to provide an interface over REST/JSON ? Check this talk to find out how.
